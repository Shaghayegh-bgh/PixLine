# PixLine

A simple project for analyzing pixel values along a line in grayscale images using **NumPy, OpenCV, and Matplotlib**, with **k-means clustering** implemented from scratch.

---

## Project Description

This project analyzes pixel intensities along a line in a grayscale image: 

loading the image, normalizing values, removing outliers, and applying k-means clustering with NumPy, with results visualized in plots.


**Project Goal:**  
- Understand **pixel intensity distribution** along a line in an image  
- Practice **basic image processing** and **k-means algorithm** without using scikit-learn

## Prerequisites

- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
